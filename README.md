# workday-scheduler
This is a workday scheduler that displays the current date and typical business hours. The time blocks are color coded depending on the current time, with gray being in the past, red being the current hour and green being in the future. After inputting an event and hitting save, the information is meant to persist even after the page has been refreshed.
This project utilizes HTML, CSS & JavaScript.
