# workday-scheduler
For this homework assignment, we were tasked with creating a workday scheduler that would display the current date and typical business hours. The time blocks are to be color coded depending on the current time, with gray being in the past, red being the current hour and green being in the future. After inputting an event and hitting save, the information is meant to persist even after the page has been refreshed.
